Doctor Appointment Booking API
A simple RESTful API built with NestJS, TypeORM, and PostgreSQL that allows you to manage doctors, view available time slots, and book appointments. It implements robust API key authentication, input validation, and generic response formatting.

Features
Doctor Management: Create, update, get, delete doctors (CRUD) with validation.

Doctor Shifts: Each doctor can have a configurable shift (start and end time) for flexible slot generation.

Appointment System: View available appointment slots (respecting the doctorâ€™s working hours and existing bookings), and book appointments with conflict/overlap detection.

Paginated Listings: Paginated endpoints for efficient data retrieval.

Environment-based Config: Appointment duration, database credentials, and API key are all configurable via .env.

Consistent API Responses: All responses standardized with utilities (successResponse, paginatedSuccessResponse).

API Key Security: All endpoints require a valid API key via the x-api-key HTTP header.
